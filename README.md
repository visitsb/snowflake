# SNOWFLAKE

Project SNOWFLAKE is an experiment to provide a guide for beautiful, minimalistic, responsive user interfaces.

Software is an art. Project SNOWFLAKE is an experiment to prove this through beautiful, minimalistic user interfaces. By suggesting alternate designs to some of most popular sites, this project wants to raise awareness on quality, beautiful, elegant human user interfaces. 

Check out some [proposals showcased](http://visitsb.github.io/snowflake/). Few popular sites were targeted a part of this independent experiment. All showcased proposals are fully responsive, and typographically adaptive. These serve to demonstrate how elegant can a user interface be while retaining all of it's usefulness. Every proposed user interface is carefully crafted and details attended with deep thought. As is often the case, many beautiful user interfaces do exist. Some notable mentions will continue to get added in showcase.

SNOWFLAKE's dream is to strive for **beauty** through human software user interfaces, promoting it towards a status equal to that of art or music.
